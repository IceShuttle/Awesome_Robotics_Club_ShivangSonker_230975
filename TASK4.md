# TASK 4

I always had interest in robotics but I never had the opportunity to build and create my own robots due to lack of proper guidance and equipments which is what I think I will get during the summer project.And I particularly liked the gyrobot as it balances without any support which I think as a sort of challenge and I like challenges.
